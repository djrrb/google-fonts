  Ubuntu Font Family
 ======================

The Ubuntu Font Family are a set of matching new libre/open fonts in
development during 2010--2011, with further expansion work and bug 
fixing in 2015 and 2022â€“-2023.  The development is being funded 
by Canonical Ltd on behalf the wider Free Software community and the
Ubuntu project.  The technical font design work and implementation has
been undertaken by Dalton Maag, Type Network, DJR, and Dual Type.

Both the final font Truetype/OpenType files and the design files used
to produce the font family are distributed under an open licence and
you are expressly encouraged to experiment, modify, share and improve.
